# CloudFlare-Product-Management
Hello! Thank you for your interest in the Cloudflare Product Management Internship Program. At Cloudflare we look for Product Managers who are curious, visionary, humble, technical, and kind. This two to three hour exercise is designed to allow you to demonstrate just how well you embody those characteristics.

You are the Product Manager for a new initiative: Cloudflare Workers for Gaming. Video games represent an exciting new opportunity for Cloudflare Workers, our distributed computing product. This vertical has unique requirements, most of which we don’t fully understand. Many of us might play video games, but few have built them.

Learn what you can about Cloudflare Workers. It might be a good idea to try out the tutorial or engineering challenge. Google, our community site, and Stack Overflow are also useful resources. Study the game development industry. Learn more about how video game developers think, what needs they have, and what problems they are trying to solve.

Submit to us a one to two page summary (in PDF format) which details a plan to deliver a Cloudflare Workers for Gaming offering to the market. Your summary should contain:

Plans to learn more about the market and its needs
Product changes or additions you believe might be valuable
Methods for improving the quality of your offering before it is released
Goals to measure the success of what you build
Risks which might lead to its failure
Our PM team has provided the following hints:

Have a thesis. What are the one or two foundational beliefs which will allow this product to win the market? Know what problem it is solving and for whom.
Everything is an experiment and a hypothesis. Describe your vision even if it might not end up being correct, but don’t hold it with too much conviction.
Delivering something quickly builds momentum and teaches us, release a version of your product as quickly as you can.
Be specific! It’s easy to say that the product should be ‘easier to use’, but if you’ve done your research you should have specific suggestions and theories. Specifics can be argued with and improved, generalities aren’t all that valuable.
